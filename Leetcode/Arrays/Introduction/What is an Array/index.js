    What is an array.
    
        An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, 
        games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory 
        locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items 
        is straightforward.

        Creating an Array
        
        On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the 
        programmer, at the time you create the Array. This is the same as when we found a big 
        enough cardboard box for the DVDs. Additionally, you also need to specify the type of 
        item that will be going into the Array.
